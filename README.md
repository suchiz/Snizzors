# Snizzors

_Seamless UIKit View Overlay for Compose Multiplatform_

Snizzors is a Compose Multiplatform library that enables you to effortlessly display UIKit views *above* your Compose content. Traditionally, integrating UIKit views within Compose Multiplatform has meant the UIKit content renders beneath the Compose view, requiring a "hole" to be cut in the Compose layout to make the UIKit content visible. Snizzors solves this by allowing true overlay, making transparent `UIView`s and `UIViewController`s viable – a capability not natively supported with standard Compose Multiplatform integration.

## Why Snizzors?

Compose Multiplatform is powerful, but when it comes to interoperability with existing UIKit components, developers often encounter a significant limitation: the default rendering order places UIKit content *under* Compose content. This creates challenges, especially for designs requiring transparency or complex layering, as transparent UIKit views simply wouldn't show through.

Snizzors solves this by:

* **Enabling true overlay:** UIKit content can now sit on top of your Compose UI, just as you'd expect.
* **Supporting transparent UIKit views:** Integrate transparent `UIView`s and `UIViewController`s seamlessly into your Compose Multiplatform app.
* **Simplifying complex UIs:** Achieve sophisticated layering and visual effects that were previously difficult or impossible.

## Getting Started

To integrate Snizzors into your Compose Multiplatform project, follow these steps:

1.  **Add the dependency:**

    ```kotlin
    // In your module's build.gradle.kts
    iosMain.dependencies {
      implementation("com.infiniteretry.snizzors:snizzors:1.0.0")
    }
    ```

2.  **Replace usages of the `UIKitView` composable with `SnizzorsUIView` and usages of `UIKitViewController` with `SnizzorsUIViewController`:**

    ```kotlin
    @Composable
    fun MyScreen() {
      SnizzorsUIView(
        factory = { MyTransparentUIView() },
        modifier = Modifier.size(300.dp),
      )
    
      SnizzorsUIViewController(
        factory = { MyTransparentUIViewController() },
        modifier = Modifier.size(300.dp),
      )
    }
    ```

## How It Works

Snizzors manages the view hierarchy on iOS, ensuring that the specified UIKit view or view controller is added to a layer *above* the Compose content, rather than below it. This enables the correct rendering of transparency and allows for a more natural integration of native UI components.
